# Stage 1.1a — Extraction Prompt v6.3

> **v6.3 changes from v6.2.** Three adjudications, all raised by batch 001
> and all previously left to the reader's judgement:
> (i) grammatical number is fixed to the paper's surface form (§ `term`);
> (ii) `Initialism of` is defined against component starts rather than word
> starts, with leading locants ignored (§ Abbreviations);
> (iii) where a paper uses variant full forms, the expansion is the variant
> whose initials the short form actually matches (§ Abbreviations).

> ### CONSTANTS
>
> ```
> GLOSS_MAX    = 22  words   (≈ 30 nomic-embed tokens)
> ```
>
> ---
>
> You are extracting structured content from a single research paper for
> ingestion into a semantic knowledge graph.
>
> Extraction is a pure function of this paper, this prompt, and these
> constants. You have no corpus, no research question, and no other paper.
> Do not reach for a connection to another field: whether this paper's
> content bridges to anything is decided downstream by geometry, over a
> corpus you cannot see. Your only job is to read this paper faithfully and
> name what is in it.
>
> Read the entire paper, then extract its terms. Favor recall, but apply the
> exclusion tests — they are not optional.
>
> Ignore the reference list, acknowledgments, and closed-form formulas.

>
> ### TERMS
>
> Any technical term, named object, or concept the paper treats as a unit.
> Length is irrelevant: a single symbol (ξ, κ), a single word (hatpin), a
> multi-word phrase (long-legged A), or a full clause naming a process
> (*shift from hydration-dominated to carbonation-dominated phase
> evolution*) all qualify equally. A clause qualifies when no word can be
> removed without losing the referent.
>
> **One term, one gloss.** A term carries exactly one gloss. If the paper
> uses one word at two levels, or in two unrelated senses, choose the
> reading the paper actually rests on and write that one.

Word class is the paper's too. Do not nominalize. Where the paper writes sorbents can be physically and chemically activated, undoing the coordination yields physically activated and chemically activated — not physical activation. If neither conjunct gives a usable term in the paper's own words, the term is not there to extract.


The exclusion tests below are long because exclusion needs defining, not because it matters more.

> **Exclusion tests.** Drop the term if any of these hold.
>
> 1. **The gloss cannot add content.** If the gloss only re-composes the
>    term's own words, the name already exhausts the thing. *noise
>    filtering* → "removal of retrieved content unrelated to the query"
>    restates the term; drop. *Scanning electron microscopy* → "imaging that
>    rasters a focused electron beam across a specimen surface" adds what
>    the name doesn't say; keep. This is a test of content, never of length.
> 2. **It is a result, not a property.** A property is true of the class of
>    things and holds outside this paper: *open-circuit voltage*,
>    *compressive strength*, *work function*, *degree of carbonation*. A
>    result is what this paper measured on its samples: *the 19.87 %
>    efficiency*, *the 139 MPa modulus*, *the reported CO2 uptake*. Extract
>    the property; the values it took here are not extracted. Where a
>    quantity has no meaning apart from the reading — where the only gloss
>    available is "the amount of X observed" — test 1 has already removed it.
> 3. **It is another term plus a qualifier.** *Theoretical CO2 uptake* is
>    *CO2 uptake* with a ceiling — one thing with a modifier, not two.
>    (*Apparent*, *absolute* and *relative density* pass: each names a
>    different measurement, not a bound on one.)
> 4. **It is apparatus.** A paper that builds a system names every part of
>    it; the parts list is scaffolding for the paper's own exposition and
>    grounds to nothing outside it. *sub-plan*, *config block*, *stage two
>    handler* — drop the whole inventory.
> 5. **Its gloss carries no subject matter.** Drop the term if you could
>    have written the same gloss had the paper studied anything else —
>    *functional unit*, *control group*, *sample size*, *calibration curve*.
>    Such a gloss lands where every field's glosses land and its edges
>    separate nothing. The test is content, not breadth: *compressive
>    strength* and *scanning electron microscopy* are used across many
>    fields and each gloss says something only that thing does. Ask whether
>    removing the domain words leaves a gloss; if there were none to remove,
>    drop it.
>
> Test 5 removes glosses with no content, not terms that many papers use. A
> term whose gloss names a specific computation or procedure stays even when
> every paper in the field carries it — *F1 score*, *recall*, *X-ray
> diffraction*. These become high-degree nodes, but they sit at precise
> coordinates and their edges land somewhere; a contentless gloss sits near
> the centre and its edges land nowhere. Degree is not the problem, vagueness
> is. A sharp gloss is also what separates the metric sense of *recall* from
> the memory and product senses the lexicon already carries.
>
> #### The complement pass — run once, over the finished draft
>
> Draft the full term list first. Then re-read every gloss and drop any term
> **that can only be glossed as the absence, remainder, or complement of
> another term on the list.** *interfacial transition zone* glosses on its
> own — a region of altered microstructure at the boundary between aggregate
> and paste. *Bulk paste* glosses only as what is left over when that region
> is removed. One of the pair carries the content; the other is its shadow.
> Keep the first, drop the second.
>
> This test is deliberately deferred. Applied while listing, it depends on
> which term you happened to write down first and silently keeps whichever
> half of the pair came earlier. Applied to the completed draft, it sees
> both halves and you choose which one carries the content.
>
> #### Fields
>
> - **`id`** — `t01`, `t02`, … in extraction order.
> - **`term`** — **the paper's own wording, character for character.** No
>   parenthetical disambiguation, no clarifying suffix, no expansion of an
>   abbreviation the paper leaves closed, no correction of a misspelling.
>   *Max*, not *Max (peak-detector feature circuit)*. *leakage*, not
>   *leakage (subthreshold conduction)*. If the paper writes *mass
>   spectroscopy* where the field writes *spectrometry*, keep
>   *spectroscopy*. Everything you want to say about which sense is meant
>   belongs in the gloss.
>
>   **Grammatical number is the paper's, not the lexicon's.** Where the
>   paper writes *activation barriers*, the term is *activation barriers*.
>   This holds after exclusion test 3 strips a qualifier: *regeneration
>   Gibbs free energies* yields *Gibbs free energies*, not *Gibbs free
>   energy* — the head noun is copied as it stands, with its number intact.
>   Lemmatization is a downstream normalization applied uniformly at
>   ingestion; doing it here silently, per term, produces a corpus that is
>   normalized in some places and not others. The gloss agrees in number
>   with the term.
>
>   One exception: **coordination may be undone.** Where the paper writes
>   *autogenous and drying shrinkage* or *sulphate and acid attack*, each
>   conjunct is a term and is written out in full — *autogenous shrinkage*,
>   *drying shrinkage* — even though that string never appears contiguously.
>   Reconstruct only what the coordination elides; add nothing else.
> - **`gloss`** — one sentence, never above
>   `GLOSS_MAX`. See below; abbreviations take a different form and are
>   exempt from both constants.
>
> #### The gloss
>
> **A complete noun phrase with its article, matching the lexicon it will be
> compared against:**
> *"The replacement of calcium hydroxide with calcium carbonate triggered by
> a chemical reaction."*
> Not *"Replacement of calcium hydroxide…"*. Never opens with *How*,
> *Whether*, or a gerund — a gloss that answers a question is not a noun
> phrase. No hedging, no citation, no notation the definition doesn't need,
> no "the authors propose."
>
> **Where the paper defines the term, that definition is the gloss.** Take
> the paper's defining sentence as the source of the content and keep its
> wording wherever it fits the form — compress it to a noun phrase inside
> `GLOSS_MAX`, cutting the paper's framing rather than its substance. Your
> own phrasing is the fallback for terms the paper uses without defining,
> not an improvement on a definition the paper supplied. Do not paraphrase a
> passing mention into a definition that isn't there.
>
> **The gloss must survive removal of the paper.** It states what the thing
> is, never what role it plays in this paper's argument, comparison, or
> exposition. Nothing that points at the document — *this study*, *this
> work*, *here*, *the present paper*, *proposed*, *our* — and nothing that
> positions the term against the paper's other objects: *reference*,
> *baseline*, *control*, *the alternative*, *compared with*. A role exists
> only inside one document and grounds to nothing outside it.
> *PEDOT:PSS* → "The conventional acidic conducting-polymer hole-transport
> material used as the reference interface layer in this study." — the
> second half is a role in one experiment. → "An acidic conducting polymer
> blend that transports holes and is widely used as a solution-processed
> interface layer."
>
> **But it must still name a subject.** Stripping the paper's role talk is
> not the same as stripping its content: a gloss driven all the way to a
> view from nowhere is all comment and no topic, and lands where every
> field's glosses land — which is exclusion test 5 again, arrived at from
> the other side. Remove what the paper's argument supplied; keep what its
> subject matter supplied.
>
> The failure to watch for is not an empty gloss but a **blank** one: same
> shape as a live gloss, same length, same grammar, and it does no work when
> fired. If the sentence would fit a dozen unrelated papers unchanged, it is
> blank. Rewrite it or drop the term.
>
> #### Abbreviations
>
> An abbreviation the paper uses is **a term in its own right**, written as
> the paper writes it — `ToF-SIMS`, `PCE`, `HTL`, `ITO`. Extract the short
> form, not the expansion.
>
> **Its gloss is the expansion, in the substrate's own form, and nothing
> else.** Use exactly one of:
>
> | form | when | example |
> |---|---|---|
> | `Initialism of <expansion>.` | read letter by letter | PCE, ITO, HTL, ToF-SIMS |
> | `Acronym of <expansion>.` | pronounced as a word | BERT, RAG, SPRING |
> | `Abbreviation of <expansion>.` | neither | approx., Dr. |
>
> No article, no explanation, no description of the referent, no qualifier.
> `GLOSS_TARGET` and `GLOSS_MAX` do not apply here; the gloss is as long as
> the expansion is. The expansion the paper gives is the one to use,
> misspelling included.
>
>
> **Choose the form by whether the letters map.** `Initialism of` claims the
> short form is built from the initial letters of the expansion; if they do
> not line up — *CCG* given as *thermally activated coal gangue* — that
> claim is false and the form is `Abbreviation of`. Check the letters
> against the expansion before choosing.
>
> **The letters map to component starts, not only to word starts.** A
> chemical name is one orthographic word built from several morphemes, and
> its short form is built from those: *MEA* / *monoethanolamine*, *MDEA* /
> *methyl diethanolamine*, *AMP* / *2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol*. Each
> letter must correspond, **in order**, to the start of a component of the
> expansion, and the first letter must open it — which is what *CCG* /
> *thermally activated coal gangue* fails, since its expansion opens with
> *t*. **Leading locants and position numerals do not carry initials** and
> are skipped before that test: *N-methyldiethanolamine* is read from
> *methyl-*, *2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol* from *amino-*.
>
> **Where the paper uses more than one full form, the expansion is the
> variant whose initials the short form matches.** A paper that introduces
> *redox-tunable Brønsted acids*, then writes *the redox-tunable acids*,
> then *the RAs*, has given two candidates; *RAs* maps to the second and
> that is the expansion. The first is not lost — it is extracted separately
> as an expanded form with its own referent gloss. This applies only where
> the paper itself supplies both forms; it never licenses reaching for a
> full form the paper does not use.
>
> **Lowercase the expansion**, except for words that are proper nouns in
> their own right: `Initialism of ordinary Portland cement.`, not
> `Initialism of Ordinary Portland Cement.` Papers title-case at first
> mention; the lexicon this gloss must land on does not. This is the one
> place the expansion is normalized rather than copied — the `term` field
> still keeps the paper's own form exactly, including variant spellings of
> the short form itself (`LC³` and `LC3` are each written as their paper
> writes them) and plural short forms (`AAMs`, `PSCs`), whose expansion is
> likewise plural.
>
> Where the paper also uses the **expanded form** in running prose and that
> form warrants a gloss of its own, extract it as a separate term with a
> normal referent gloss. This is how the referent description survives: on
> the expanded form, not inside the abbreviation.
>
> **If the paper never spells the short form out, give it a normal referent
> gloss instead.** Do not supply an expansion from your own knowledge,
> however standard it seems. An expansion the paper does not give cannot be
> checked against the paper, and a wrong one is worse than none.
>
> **Scope.** This rule covers short forms of a longer name. It does not
> reach project or model names that are not short for anything (SPRING,
> GRAPES, AMRBART), chemical or material designations (EHCz-3EtCz,
> EH44-3C-diMA), symbols carrying a subscript (E_HOMO), argument or role
> labels (ARG0), or a term with a suffix attached (HTM-ox). These are
> ordinary terms with ordinary glosses — they are not excluded, they simply
> take the normal form.

The recall pass — run once, before the complement pass
Re-read the paper looking only for names. Every designation it prints — material and product codes (ADS-17, MCM-41, ImCOF-TAEA), reagents and compounds (K₂CO₃, glycine, piperazine), instruments, methods, models — is a term unless it fails an exclusion test. Papers carry these in lists and parentheticals that a first reading slides past. The exclusion tests exist to remove vagueness, and a named designation is never vague. A name the paper prints with no entry in your draft is an omission, not a judgement.
